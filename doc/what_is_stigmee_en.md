# What is Stigmee ?

Stigmee is a decentralized and open source web browser and social network 3D,
made with Godot and the Chromium Embedded Framework, it is designed to run on PC
(Linux, Mac OS, Windows...) and expected for mobile (iOS, Android). It can be
seen as an open source competitor and decentralized direct to the Metaverse, but
it is much more than that. In Stigmee, the users (the Stigmers) assemble
collections of relevant web addresses, such as collections of tabs in a browser.
Assembling a series of URLs can take between 15 minutes and 15 hours depending on
the topic (which restaurant are we going to tonight? 15 mins; which
cryptocurrency to buy? 15 hours) and when a user closes his window with his
relevant tabs, all that work is wasted. To not have loosing them, Stigmee preserves
them anonymously and uses them for offering a collection of relevant tabs to the user
directly, potentially saving him 15 hours since nobody wants to see 30 pop-up
tabs in their browser at the same time, Stigmee requires containing the
experience and the interface: it's there where the 3D web and Godot take actions: the
tab series is represented as a "strand", depicted by the shore of a river in where URLs
are spatialized as lands by a river this strand can be copied, modified, shared
(modified). This working method is comparable to that of WAZE which uses the
paths traveled by motorists to calculate the best paths possible, it is called
STIGMERGY and comes from hives and anthills.  This is why the network is called
STIGMEE.
